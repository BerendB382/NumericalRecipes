\section{Exercise 1: Poisson distribution}

In this section, the solutions to the first exercise are presented. 

Our script is given by:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Poisson.py}

As apparent from the code above, we have adopted a computation in log space. This avoids possible overflow errors and enables us to compute the Poisson probability for larger $(\lambda, k)$ pairs. The output for a representative sample of pairs is given below, which demonstrates that the returned Poisson probability is accurate when compared to calculations done in online calculators.
